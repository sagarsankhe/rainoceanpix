    <strong>An IT firm</strong> which will work with local engineering colleges to harness the local talent. Due extremely high number of colleges in India, it is difficult for prominent IT firms to show presence and recruit at all colleges. This results in major chunk of engineers not getting placement at the campus itself. Also due to lack of decent funding to these colleges which is required for good infrastructure, hiring trained professors, for the investment in R&D for IPRs, acquiring relevant projects from industries and get students work on them.  Also the education system is outdated, not having been updated for decades. This is changing however. 
<br><br>
This indeed is an opportunity for small firms to invest in these students. They are willing to work, contribute even if the starting compensation is not with par of college placements. Their hard work, and dedication if combined with training, infrastructure, proper guidance can result into a quality product which can reap in huge benefits for all. 
<br><br>
Infra needed for this venture. (as of now plan is very loose): Experienced trainers (with experience in handling such newbies), a decent office with desktops, servers, proper network. A state of the art R&D lab will require a secure environment for developing, testing, implementing software and hardware products.

I am drafting list of things. I will send for approval under project billing. We will need many things for the first project. (Camera, audio, video) Content editor s/w for editing the marketing content. An expert on traffic surveillance projects (IoT professional). Customer firm was clear on requirements. They are going to host workshop in May-21. Monitoring traffic and performing analytics is priority. My laptop, mobile are outdated piece of h/w. I need update to first make a workable prototype to showcase before March last week.
<br><br>
My life has always been home-traffic-office-traffic-home. It is this lockdown I realised I have numerous ideas of small business ventures. While volunteering I realized that climate is in danger. I have profitable ventures which can tackle environment issues as well as create jobs. IT firm, Manufacturing firm, and more to come.
